# Agentris Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Achieve 60% automation of Salesforce configuration tickets within 6 months of deployment
- Reduce average ticket resolution time by 40% through intelligent automation and ambiguity resolution
- Enable consultants to handle 30% more tickets per sprint without additional hiring
- Improve implementation quality with 95% first-time-right rate and <5% post-deployment bug rate
- Generate comprehensive audit trails and client-ready documentation for all automated work
- Build trust through transparent previews and human approval gates for all changes
- Create competitive advantage for implementation partners through AI-powered efficiency
- Capture and reuse institutional knowledge across consultant teams

### Background Context

Agentris addresses the existential threat facing Salesforce implementation partners as AI automation becomes table stakes in the consulting industry. With over 50% of Jira tickets containing ambiguous requirements and consultants spending 30-40% of their time on repetitive configurations, the current manual-heavy model is unsustainable. Partners who fail to adopt intelligent automation will lose deals to more efficient competitors who can deliver faster, cheaper, and with higher quality.

The platform transforms the consultant workflow by acting as an intelligent team member that reads Jira tickets, detects ambiguities, generates clarifying questions, and executes Salesforce configurations with full transparency. By combining domain-specific Salesforce expertise with human oversight and control, Agentris enables consultants to focus on complex, high-value problems while routine work is automated safely and reliably.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The Agentris interface embodies "Progressive Disclosure with Full Control" - presenting consultants with a clean, focused workflow that reveals complexity only when needed. The UI should feel like a natural extension of existing tools (Jira/Salesforce) while adding intelligent assistance layers. Every interaction should build trust through transparency, showing what the AI is thinking and doing at each step.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Approval-First Workflow:** Nothing executes without explicit consultant review and approval
- **Context-Aware Previews:** Changes shown in the most appropriate format (visual for layouts, code diff for Apex, flow diagram for automation)
- **Progressive Detail:** Summary view by default with ability to drill into full technical details
- **Inline Assistance:** AI suggestions and clarifications appear within the natural workflow, not as popups or separate screens
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live status updates as the system analyzes, generates, and executes changes
- **Batch Operations:** Ability to review and approve multiple similar changes as a group

### Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard:** Overview of assigned tickets, automation metrics, recent activity
- **Ticket Analysis View:** Shows Jira ticket with AI analysis, ambiguity detection, and suggested clarifications
- **Change Preview Screen:** Side-by-side before/after comparison with impact analysis
- **Approval Workflow:** Clear approve/reject/modify interface with comment capability
- **Execution Monitor:** Real-time progress tracking during deployment with detailed logs
- **Audit Trail View:** Comprehensive history of all actions, decisions, and outcomes
- **Settings & Configuration:** Manage Salesforce org connections, notification preferences, team permissions

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The system will meet WCAG AA standards ensuring usability for consultants with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and appropriate color contrast ratios.

### Branding

Clean, professional interface aligned with Salesforce Lightning Design System aesthetics to feel familiar to consultants. Subtle AI-assistant visual cues (e.g., processing animations, thinking indicators) that don't distract from core work. Client-white-label capability for enterprise deployments (Phase 2).

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop browsers (where consultants do most work) with responsive design for tablet review/approval scenarios. Mobile access for notifications and quick approvals only - not full functionality.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

We'll use a monorepo structure to maintain all services, packages, and infrastructure code in a single repository. This enables atomic commits across services, simplified dependency management, and consistent tooling. The monorepo will have clear package boundaries for core logic, integrations (Jira, Salesforce, Bitbucket), UI, and shared utilities.

### Service Architecture

**Modular Monolith** - The system will be built as a modular monolith that can be split into microservices later if needed:

- **API Module** - REST API endpoints with authentication middleware
- **Auth Module** - Handle OAuth flows for Jira, Salesforce, Bitbucket integrations
- **Jira Integration Module** - Ticket reading, comment posting, status updates
- **Salesforce Integration Module** - Org authentication, metadata operations, deployments
- **AI Engine Module** - LLM interactions, ambiguity detection, recommendation generation
- **Preview Generator Module** - Create visual previews, diagrams, and change comparisons
- **Bitbucket Module** - Version control operations, PR creation
- **Audit Module** - Logging, tracking, and compliance reporting

This architecture maintains clear separation of concerns with module boundaries while avoiding the complexity of distributed systems for MVP. Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces that can become API calls if we split to microservices later.

### Testing Requirements

**Full Testing Pyramid** implementation:

- **Unit Tests:** Minimum 80% code coverage for all business logic
- **Integration Tests:** API contract testing between services, external API mocking
- **End-to-End Tests:** Critical user journeys automated with Playwright or Cypress
- **Manual Testing Support:** Feature flags and sandbox environments for safe testing
- **AI Output Validation:** Automated testing framework for LLM responses against known good outputs
- **Salesforce Deployment Testing:** Automated validation in sandbox before production deployment

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript for type safety and developer productivity
- **Backend Language:** Node.js/TypeScript for consistency across stack
- **LLM Provider:** Claude (via Anthropic SDK) with abstraction layer for provider switching
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching
- **Background Jobs:** Bull queue for Node.js for async LLM processing
- **Deployment:** Local development first, then simple cloud deployment (Heroku/Railway/Render)
- **Containers:** Docker for development consistency only
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing on every commit
- **Monitoring:** Simple application logs initially, add monitoring as needed
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger for all endpoints
- **Security:** Environment variables for secrets, HTTPS for production
- **Scaling:** Not required for MVP - single instance sufficient
