## Session Notes

### First Principles Thinking

**Fundamental Actions for Jira Ticket Execution:**

1. Understand what needs to be done
2. Know the acceptance criteria
3. Access the right Salesforce org
4. Make changes
5. Test and verify the changes work
6. Update the Jira ticket

**Deep Dive Insights:**

1. **Understanding Requirements:**
   - Requirements found in ticket description and status
   - Common pattern: "As a [role], I want [the system to...], so that I can [...]"
   - Pattern is inconsistent - not always structured this way

2. **Acceptance Criteria Challenges:**
   - No consistent format (not always Given/When/Then)
   - Over 50% are ambiguous or incomplete
   - Major pain point for execution

3. **Org Access:**
   - Credentials stored in 1Password
   - Not documented in tickets or Confluence
   - Manual lookup process required
   - **Solution:** Salesforce CLI with one-time consultant authorization

**Key Opportunities Identified:**

1. **Ambiguity Detection & Resolution:**
   - AI can detect ambiguous acceptance criteria automatically
   - Generate clarifying questions for stakeholders
   - Suggest missing criteria based on similar past tickets
   - This addresses the 50%+ ambiguity problem

2. **Authentication Solution:**
   - Use Salesforce CLI for secure access
   - One-time authorization by consultant per org
   - Eliminates need for direct credential management

3. **Automation Potential:**
   - Estimated 60% of tickets could be fully automated
   - Simple tasks (field additions, validation rules) = full automation
   - Complex tasks (process design) = human-AI collaboration

### Role Playing - Stakeholder Perspectives

**Salesforce Consultant Perspective - Trust & Control Requirements:**

1. **Transparency & Explainability:**
   - AI must clearly explain what it does and will do
   - Verbose logging of all actions
   - Visualizations where possible (process flows, screen mockups)

2. **Safety & Approval Mechanisms:**
   - Every change requires approval before execution
   - All work done in sandbox first
   - All changes must be revertable/undoable
3. **Decision Support:**
   - When multiple implementation options exist, AI stops and asks for direction
   - Never assumes the "best" path without consultant input
   - Presents pros/cons of different approaches

**Enhanced Change Preview Feature:**

- Before/after screenshots (mocked up)
- Impact analysis showing affected processes
- Rollback plan for each change
- Estimated testing scenarios
- _This feature strongly resonates as valuable_

**MVP Scoping Decisions:**

- Personalized learning patterns - NOT in MVP (keep it simple)
- Focus on consistent, predictable behavior first
- For the 40% non-automated tickets: AI assists with user guidance
- Human-in-the-loop collaboration model for complex tickets

---

### SCAMPER Method

**S - Substitute:**

- AI reads and interprets Jira tickets (instead of manual reading)
- AI generates code/config (instead of writing from scratch)
- AI searches documentation (tech docs, proposals, other tickets)
- Automated testing (unit, E2E, headless and headed) instead of manual

**C - Combine:**

- Integrate with Bitbucket for version control
- Combine with test automation tools
- Integrate documentation generators
- Create unified workflow across all tools

**A - Adapt:**

- (To be explored based on patterns from other industries)

**M - Modify/Magnify:**
Key capabilities to magnify:

- Ask clarifying questions (address 50%+ ambiguity)
- Generate multiple implementation options
- Actually implement the solutions
- _These three capabilities should be the core focus_

**P - Put to Other Uses:**

- Keep focused on primary use case for MVP
- No secondary uses initially

**E - Eliminate:**
Process steps to completely remove:

- Status update meetings (AI provides real-time updates)
- Manual ticket triaging (AI auto-categorizes)
- Code/config errors (AI validates before implementation)
- Manual testing (fully automated testing)

---

### "Yes, And..." Building

**Collaborative idea expansion:**

1. AI reads Jira tickets and asks clarifying questions when ambiguous
2. **Yes, and** it ranks questions by importance/impact
3. **Yes, and** it updates the ticket correspondingly
4. **Yes, and** uses [AI-CLARIFIED] tags for transparency
5. **Yes, and** AI has its own Jira user account
6. **Yes, and** creates complete audit trail with screenshots
7. **Yes, and** logs summary of thinking, decisions, and activities
8. **Yes, and** thinking logs become training material for new consultants
9. **Yes, and** consultant-guided decisions help AI improve future recommendations

**Key Insight:** The system creates a virtuous cycle - consultant guidance improves AI decisions, which creates better documentation, which trains both new consultants AND the AI itself.
