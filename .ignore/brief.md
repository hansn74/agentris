# Project Brief: Agentris

## Executive Summary

**Agentris** is an AI-powered consultant agent that automates Salesforce implementation work by intelligently reading, analyzing, and executing Jira tickets. The platform addresses the critical inefficiencies in Salesforce consultancy workflows where over 50% of tickets contain ambiguous requirements and consultants spend significant time on repetitive configuration tasks.

**Primary Target:** Salesforce implementation partners and their consultants who manage multiple client orgs and need to streamline their delivery process.

**Key Value Proposition:** Agentris reduces manual effort by 60% through intelligent automation of simple Salesforce configurations while providing transparency and control through change previews, clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements, and comprehensive audit trails - ultimately enabling consultants to focus on complex, high-value client problems.

## Problem Statement

Salesforce implementation partners face mounting competitive pressure in a rapidly evolving market. As AI-powered automation becomes standard across industries, partners who fail to adopt these technologies risk losing clients to more efficient competitors. The current manual-heavy delivery model presents several critical challenges:

**Ambiguous Requirements Crisis:** Over 50% of Jira tickets contain unclear or incomplete acceptance criteria, forcing consultants into time-consuming clarification cycles that delay delivery and frustrate clients.

**Repetitive Work Inefficiency:** Consultants spend 30-40% of their time on repetitive, low-complexity configuration tasks (custom fields, validation rules, page layouts) that follow predictable patterns yet are performed manually each time.

**Quality Control Gaps:** Despite manual testing efforts consuming 25-40% of implementation time, clients still discover bugs post-delivery, damaging trust and requiring costly emergency fixes. These quality issues stem from inconsistent testing coverage and human oversight in complex org configurations.

**Competitive Disadvantage:** Forward-thinking implementation partners are already exploring AI automation. Partners without these capabilities will inevitably lose deals to competitors who can deliver faster, cheaper, and with higher quality. This is not a future risk - it's happening now.

**Knowledge Fragmentation:** Solutions discovered by one consultant aren't systematically captured, causing teams to repeatedly solve identical problems. This inefficiency compounds as teams grow and client demands increase.

**Client Experience Impact:** Extended delivery timelines, post-deployment bugs, and inconsistent implementation quality directly impact client satisfaction. Clients expect the speed and reliability they see in other automated services.

The strategic imperative is clear: implementation partners must automate routine work to remain competitive. Those who don't will face declining margins, client defection, and eventual irrelevance in an AI-augmented marketplace.

## Proposed Solution

Agentris is an intelligent AI agent that seamlessly integrates into existing Salesforce implementation workflows, acting as a force multiplier for consultant teams. The solution operates as an autonomous team member that reads Jira tickets, analyzes requirements, and executes Salesforce configurations with human oversight.

**Core Solution Architecture:**

At its heart, Agentris leverages large language models to understand natural language requirements in Jira tickets and translate them into precise Salesforce configurations. The system connects directly to Jira and Confluence for requirement gathering, uses Salesforce CLI for secure org access, and maintains full audit trails of all decisions and actions.

**Intelligent Ambiguity Resolution:** When Agentris detects unclear requirements (addressing the 50% ambiguity problem), it automatically generates clarifying questions ranked by importance. Rather than consultants spending hours in back-and-forth communications, Agentris presents specific, targeted questions that get to the heart of what's needed.

**Transparent Automation with Control:** For the 60% of tickets that can be automated, Agentris presents a complete change preview before execution - including before/after mockups, impact analysis, and rollback plans. Consultants maintain full control with approval gates at critical points, ensuring nothing happens without explicit consent.

**Collaborative Intelligence:** For complex tickets beyond full automation, Agentris shifts into an intelligent assistant mode, providing implementation suggestions, identifying similar past solutions, and generating test scenarios. This human-AI collaboration model ensures even complex work benefits from automation assistance.

**Why This Succeeds Where Others Haven't:**

Unlike generic automation tools or code generators, Agentris understands the specific context of Salesforce implementation work. It knows the difference between a validation rule and a workflow rule, understands the implications of field-level security, and recognizes common Salesforce patterns. This domain expertise, combined with transparent operation and human control, creates a solution consultants can trust.

The system learns from every interaction - consultant approvals, rejections, and modifications train Agentris to make better recommendations over time, creating a virtuous cycle where the tool becomes more valuable with use.
