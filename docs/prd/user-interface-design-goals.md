# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Agentris interface embodies "Progressive Disclosure with Full Control" - presenting consultants with a clean, focused workflow that reveals complexity only when needed. The UI should feel like a natural extension of existing tools (Jira/Salesforce) while adding intelligent assistance layers. Every interaction should build trust through transparency, showing what the AI is thinking and doing at each step.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Approval-First Workflow:** Nothing executes without explicit consultant review and approval
- **Context-Aware Previews:** Changes shown in the most appropriate format (visual for layouts, code diff for Apex, flow diagram for automation)
- **Progressive Detail:** Summary view by default with ability to drill into full technical details
- **Inline Assistance:** AI suggestions and clarifications appear within the natural workflow, not as popups or separate screens
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live status updates as the system analyzes, generates, and executes changes
- **Batch Operations:** Ability to review and approve multiple similar changes as a group

## Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard:** Overview of assigned tickets, automation metrics, recent activity
- **Ticket Analysis View:** Shows Jira ticket with AI analysis, ambiguity detection, and suggested clarifications
- **Change Preview Screen:** Side-by-side before/after comparison with impact analysis
- **Approval Workflow:** Clear approve/reject/modify interface with comment capability
- **Execution Monitor:** Real-time progress tracking during deployment with detailed logs
- **Audit Trail View:** Comprehensive history of all actions, decisions, and outcomes
- **Settings & Configuration:** Manage Salesforce org connections, notification preferences, team permissions

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The system will meet WCAG AA standards ensuring usability for consultants with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and appropriate color contrast ratios.

## Branding

Clean, professional interface aligned with Salesforce Lightning Design System aesthetics to feel familiar to consultants. Subtle AI-assistant visual cues (e.g., processing animations, thinking indicators) that don't distract from core work. Client-white-label capability for enterprise deployments (Phase 2).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop browsers (where consultants do most work) with responsive design for tablet review/approval scenarios. Mobile access for notifications and quick approvals only - not full functionality.
