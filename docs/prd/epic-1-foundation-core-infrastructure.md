# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the foundational architecture, authentication system, and basic Jira integration to demonstrate a working end-to-end flow. This epic delivers a deployable system that can read Jira tickets, process them through a basic pipeline, and display results to users, proving the core architectural patterns.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Monorepo Structure

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured monorepo with all necessary tooling,  
**So that** the team can efficiently develop the modular application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Monorepo initialized with simple workspace structure
2. Package structure created for modules, shared libs, and UI
3. TypeScript configuration standardized across all packages
4. ESLint and Prettier configured with pre-commit hooks
5. Docker compose setup for local development (app + PostgreSQL + Redis)
6. README with setup instructions and architecture overview

## Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**As a** developer,  
**I want** automated CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment,  
**So that** code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers on PR and merge to main
2. Automated linting, type checking, and unit tests run on every commit
3. Docker images built and pushed to registry on successful main builds
4. Deployment scripts for staging environment configured
5. Build status badges visible in repository README

## Story 1.3: Core Authentication Service

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** a centralized authentication service,  
**So that** users can securely access the system with role-based permissions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Auth service implements JWT-based authentication
2. User registration and login endpoints functional
3. Role-based access control (RBAC) with consultant/manager/admin roles
4. Session management with refresh token support
5. Password reset flow implemented with email verification
6. Integration tests cover all auth scenarios

## Story 1.4: API Layer Implementation

**As a** frontend developer,  
**I want** a well-structured API layer,  
**So that** the UI has a consistent interface to all backend modules.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Express/Fastify API with route organization by module
2. Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens
3. Rate limiting implemented per user/endpoint
4. Request/response logging for debugging
5. CORS properly configured for frontend access
6. Health check endpoint for application status

## Story 1.5: Jira Integration Service - Basic

**As a** consultant,  
**I want** the system to connect to Jira and read my tickets,  
**So that** I can see which tickets are ready for automation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. OAuth 2.0 flow implemented for Jira authentication
2. Service can fetch tickets assigned to authenticated user
3. Ticket details (description, acceptance criteria, comments) retrieved
4. Webhook listener for real-time ticket updates configured
5. Error handling for API rate limits and connection issues
6. Jira connection settings configurable per user

## Story 1.6: Basic Web UI Shell

**As a** consultant,  
**I want** a web interface to view my Jira tickets,  
**So that** I can see which tickets the system has identified.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. React application with TypeScript setup complete
2. Login/logout flow connected to Auth service
3. Dashboard displays list of Jira tickets for logged-in user
4. Ticket detail view shows full ticket information
5. Responsive design works on desktop and tablet
6. Loading states and error handling implemented
