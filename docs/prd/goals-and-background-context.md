# Goals and Background Context

- Improve implementation quality with 95% first-time-right rate and <5% post-deployment bug rate
- Generate comprehensive audit trails and client-ready documentation for all automated work

- Create competitive advantage for implementation partners through AI-powered efficiency
- Capture and reuse institutional knowledge across consultant teams

## Background Context

Agentris addresses the existential threat facing Salesforce implementation partners as AI automation becomes table stakes in the consulting industry. With over 50% of Jira tickets containing ambiguous requirements and consultants spending 30-40% of their time on repetitive configurations, the current manual-heavy model is unsustainable. Partners who fail to adopt intelligent automation will lose deals to more efficient competitors who can deliver faster, cheaper, and with higher quality.

The platform transforms the consultant workflow by acting as an intelligent team member that reads Jira tickets, detects ambiguities, generates clarifying questions, and executes Salesforce configurations with full transparency. By combining domain-specific Salesforce expertise with human oversight and control, Agentris enables consultants to focus on complex, high-value problems while routine work is automated safely and reliably.
