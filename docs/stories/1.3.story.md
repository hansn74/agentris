### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]

User model TypeScript interface:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'CONSULTANT' | 'MANAGER' | 'ADMIN';
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActive: Date;
  organizations: Organization[];
  tickets: Ticket[];
}
```

### Authentication Configuration

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

- JWT-based authentication with HTTPOnly cookies
- 24-hour session timeout
- OAuth 2.0 for all external integrations
- Encrypted tokens stored in database
- Rate limiting per user/endpoint required

### Environment Variables

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#environment-configuration]

Required for auth service:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/agentris

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here-generate-with-openssl

# Redis (for session storage)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### API Structure

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#trpc-router-definitions]

tRPC router pattern to follow:

- All procedures must use Zod validation
- Use `publicProcedure` for open endpoints
- Use `protectedProcedure` for authenticated endpoints
- Error handling with standard error handler
- Input/output types defined in shared package

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Type Sharing**: Define all auth types in packages/shared/src/types/auth.ts
- **API Calls**: Use tRPC procedures only, no direct HTTP
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects
- **Authentication**: Use protectedProcedure for auth routes
- **Validation**: All inputs validated with Zod
- **Database Access**: Only through repository pattern
- **Error Handling**: All procedures must use standard error handler

### Technical Constraints

- NextAuth.js version must be v4.24.x (not v5/Auth.js)
- Prisma version must be v5.8.x
- All auth tokens must be stored encrypted
- Session cookies must be HTTPOnly
- CORS must be properly configured for frontend access

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Framework**: Vitest v1.2.x
- **Test Files**: Co-located as `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- **Test Execution**: Via `pnpm test` using Turborepo
- **Integration Tests**: Required for all auth scenarios
- **Test Location**:
  - Unit tests: Next to source files
  - Integration tests: `packages/auth/src/__tests__/`

For this story specifically:

- Mock Prisma client for unit tests
- Use test database for integration tests
- Test all role combinations
- Verify token expiration handling
- Test rate limiting behavior

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The authentication implementation demonstrates solid functional completeness with all 6 acceptance criteria successfully met. The codebase shows good organization with 33 passing tests covering critical authentication flows. However, several high-priority security vulnerabilities and architectural concerns require immediate attention before production deployment.

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive test coverage (33 tests) across all authentication scenarios
- Proper JWT implementation with refresh token mechanism
- Well-structured RBAC with hierarchical role permissions
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- Clean separation of concerns across packages

**Critical Issues Identified:**

- Hardcoded development secrets with fallback values pose production risk
- Type safety bypassed in JWT callbacks enabling potential privilege escalation
- Sensitive data (reset tokens) exposed in console logs
- Missing global rate limiting for login attempts
- No server-side session invalidation mechanism

### Refactoring Performed

No automated refactoring was performed during this review due to the critical nature of authentication code. All identified issues require careful manual intervention to ensure security integrity is maintained.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Type safety violations with `any` usage, inconsistent error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows monorepo structure with proper package separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests, though integration tests use mocks
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Security Fixes (Must address before production):**

- [ ] Remove hardcoded development secrets fallback in auth config
- [ ] Fix type safety issues in JWT callbacks (remove `any` usage)
- [ ] Remove sensitive data from console logs (password reset tokens)
- [ ] Implement proper environment variable validation with fail-fast

**Security Enhancements (Should address soon):**

- [ ] Add global rate limiting for login attempts (not just password reset)
- [ ] Implement server-side session invalidation
- [ ] Add CORS configuration and security headers
- [ ] Implement audit logging for authentication events
- [ ] Add account lockout mechanism after failed attempts

**Code Quality Improvements:**

- [ ] Centralize configuration management
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types throughout (eliminate `any`)
- [ ] Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels
- [ ] Add database query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to configuration constants

**Testing Enhancements:**

- [ ] Add true integration tests with test database
- [ ] Implement security testing (OWASP test cases)
- [ ] Add load testing for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Test concurrent authentication scenarios
- [ ] Add chaos testing for resilience

### Security Review

**High Risk Vulnerabilities Found:**

1. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Development fallback secrets in production code (auth/config/index.ts:8)
2. **Type Confusion**: JWT role assignment bypasses type validation (auth/callbacks/index.ts:22)
3. **Token Exposure**: Password reset tokens logged to console (api/routers/auth.ts:112)

**Medium Risk Issues:**

- Insufficient rate limiting coverage (only password reset protected)
- No multi-factor authentication capability
- Missing session concurrency controls
- No IP-based restrictions or geolocation checks

**Recommendations:**

- Immediate: Address all high-risk vulnerabilities before any deployment
- Short-term: Implement comprehensive rate limiting and session management
- Long-term: Consider MFA and advanced threat detection

### Performance Considerations

- **bcrypt Rounds**: Current setting (12) is appropriate but consider async queue for high load
- **JWT Verification**: Every request validates JWT without caching mechanism
- **Database Queries**: No evident query optimization or connection pooling configuration
- **Session Storage**: Consider Redis for session storage instead of JWT-only approach

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. All recommendations require careful manual implementation due to security-critical nature of authentication code.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-core-authentication-service.yml

- 3 high-risk security vulnerabilities require immediate attention
- Functional requirements fully met with comprehensive test coverage
- Security fixes must be implemented before production deployment

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

**Priority Actions Required:**

1. Address all high-risk security vulnerabilities immediately
2. Implement global rate limiting for authentication endpoints
3. Add server-side session management capabilities
4. Enhance monitoring and audit logging

While the implementation successfully meets all functional requirements, the identified security vulnerabilities present unacceptable risk for production deployment. The development team should prioritize security fixes while preserving the solid functional foundation that has been established.

### Review Date: 2025-09-08 (Post-QA Fixes)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Following the previous QA review, significant improvements have been made to address security vulnerabilities. The implementation now includes comprehensive rate limiting, server-side session management, and extracted constants. However, one critical security issue remains unresolved.

**QA Fixes Successfully Applied:**

- ✓ SEC-002: Type safety improved throughout, proper TypeScript types added
- ✓ SEC-003: Sensitive tokens no longer logged to console, structured logging implemented
- ✓ SEC-004: Global rate limiting implemented for all auth endpoints (login, register, password reset)
- ✓ ARCH-001: Server-side session invalidation mechanism with SessionManager implemented
- ✓ NFR: Magic numbers extracted to constants (auth.ts), improved overall type safety
- ✓ All 29 API tests passing, demonstrating functional integrity maintained

**Critical Issue Still Present:**

- ✗ SEC-001: Hardcoded fallback secret still exists in callbacks/index.ts:5
  - `const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET || 'development-secret';`
  - While config/index.ts properly validates environment variables, the callbacks file still contains fallback

### Refactoring Performed

No automated refactoring performed in this review. The critical security issue requires careful manual correction to ensure proper environment variable validation without fallback values.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Significant improvement in type safety, constants usage
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows monorepo structure with proper package separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ 29 tests passing, comprehensive coverage maintained
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
- Security Standards: ✗ One critical hardcoded secret remains

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Security Fix (Must address immediately):**

- [ ] Remove 'development-secret' fallback in packages/auth/src/callbacks/index.ts:5

**Successfully Addressed (from previous review):**

- [x] Implemented global rate limiting for all auth endpoints
- [x] Added server-side session invalidation with SessionManager
- [x] Removed sensitive data from console logs
- [x] Fixed type safety issues (removed most `any` usage)
- [x] Extracted magic numbers to configuration constants

**Minor Code Quality Issues:**

- [ ] Fix Prettier formatting issues (47 formatting violations detected)
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests with real database
- [ ] Add CORS configuration for production deployment

### Security Review

**Critical Vulnerability Remaining:**

1. **Hardcoded Secret Fallback**: packages/auth/src/callbacks/index.ts:5 still contains `|| 'development-secret'`

**Security Improvements Implemented:**

- Rate limiting properly configured for all authentication endpoints
- Session management with proper invalidation capabilities
- Secure token handling without console exposure
- Proper type safety throughout authentication flow

### Performance Considerations

- Rate limiting store currently uses in-memory Map (appropriate for MVP, needs Redis for production)
- Session cleanup scheduled every hour (appropriate interval)
- bcrypt salt rounds at 12 (good balance of security and performance)

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-core-authentication-service.yml

- 1 critical security vulnerability (hardcoded secret) blocks production deployment
- 5 of 6 originally identified issues have been successfully resolved
- Functional requirements fully met with comprehensive test coverage

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - Critical Security Issue]

**Immediate Action Required:**

1. Remove the hardcoded 'development-secret' fallback in callbacks/index.ts
2. Ensure environment variable validation fails fast without fallback values

The development team has made excellent progress addressing the security concerns. Once the remaining hardcoded secret is removed, this implementation will be ready for production deployment. The authentication service demonstrates solid architecture and comprehensive test coverage.
