# Story 3.6: Batch Processing Intelligence

## Status

Done ✅

## Story

**As a** consultant,  
**I want** similar tickets grouped for efficient processing,  
**So that** I can handle multiple tickets at once.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identify tickets with similar requirements
2. Group tickets by change type and object
3. Generate combined preview for batch changes
4. Allow individual ticket exclusion from batch
5. Single approval for entire batch
6. Maintain individual ticket tracking in Jira

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.5 successfully implemented Context-Aware Recommendations with:
- PatternAnalyzer for org metadata analysis (`packages/ai-engine/src/pattern-analyzer.ts`)
- RecommendationEngine with AI-powered suggestions (`packages/ai-engine/src/recommendation-engine.ts`)
- ConflictDetector for identifying conflicts (`packages/ai-engine/src/conflict-detector.ts`)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (`packages/api/src/ws/recommendation-updates.ts`)
- Analytics tracking with dashboard (`packages/services/src/recommendation-analytics.ts`)
[Source: Story 3.5 Completion Notes]

### Existing Infrastructure
The AI Engine package already has:
- LLMService for all Claude API interactions with caching and retry logic
- AmbiguityDetector that identifies specific areas needing clarification
- ClarificationGenerator for creating questions based on ambiguities
- PreviewGenerator and ChangeDetector from Story 3.4
- PatternAnalyzer and RecommendationEngine from Story 3.5
- Prompt template pattern established in `packages/ai-engine/src/prompts/`

### Data Models
**Ticket Model** (existing):
```prisma
model Ticket {
  id                 String       @id @default(cuid())
  jiraKey            String       @unique
  jiraId             String       @unique
  summary            String
  description        String       @db.Text
  status             TicketStatus @default(NEW)
  ambiguityScore     Float?
  acceptanceCriteria String?      @db.Text
  assignedToId       String
  organizationId     String
  userId             String?
  automationSuccess  Boolean?
  createdAt          DateTime     @default(now())

**New Models Needed**:
- TicketBatch model to group similar tickets
- BatchApproval model for batch-level approvals
- BatchProcessingResult model for tracking batch execution

**Analysis Model** (existing - for storing similarity scores):
```prisma
model Analysis {
  id           String            @id @default(cuid())
  ticketId     String
  type         AnalysisType      // Add 'BATCH_SIMILARITY' type
  findings     Json              // Store similarity scores and grouping data
  score        Float
  confidence   Float
  createdAt    DateTime          @default(now())
}
```

## QA Results

### Quality Gate Decision: PASS WITH CONCERNS ⚠️

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Reviewer:** Quinn (QA Agent)
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.1

### Summary
Story 3.6 successfully implements batch processing intelligence with comprehensive functionality across all layers. Core requirements are met with good test coverage, but some gaps in UI testing and external integration testing need attention before production deployment.

### Traceability Matrix
- ✅ All 6 acceptance criteria implemented and traceable
- ✅ 10/10 development tasks completed
- ✅ Database schema, services, API, and UI components delivered
- ⚠️ UI component tests missing (0/5 components tested)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** ✅ 5 test files, ~85% coverage estimated
- **Integration Tests:** ✅ API and service layer covered
- **UI Tests:** ❌ Missing component tests
- **E2E Tests:** ⚠️ WebSocket updates not tested
- **Performance:** ✅ Validated <5s for 20 tickets, <3s preview generation

### Risk Items
1. **HIGH:** Jira sync only tested with mocks - production issues likely
2. **MEDIUM:** No rate limiting implemented despite documented requirement
3. **MEDIUM:** Missing UI tests could hide interaction bugs
4. **LOW:** Batch rollback scenarios undertested

### Security & NFRs
- ✅ Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ⚠️ Rate limiting missing (50 req/min requirement)
- ⚠️ No caching for expensive LLM operations
- ✅ Performance within acceptable thresholds

### Required Actions Before Production
1. Add UI component tests for all 5 batch components
2. Implement rate limiting on batch endpoints
3. Add Jira integration tests with actual API
4. Test WebSocket real-time updates end-to-end

### Recommendations
- Consider adding circuit breaker for LLM service
- Implement caching for similarity calculations
- Add batch operation audit logging
- Extract magic numbers to configuration

### Quality Score: 7.5/10
Strong implementation with good architecture and test coverage at service layer. UI testing gap and missing production safeguards (rate limiting, real Jira tests) prevent higher score.
