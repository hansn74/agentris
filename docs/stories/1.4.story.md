# Story 1.4: API Layer Implementation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** frontend developer,  
**I want** a well-structured API layer,  
**So that** the UI has a consistent interface to all backend modules.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Express/Fastify API with route organization by module
2. Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens
3. Rate limiting implemented per user/endpoint
4. Request/response logging for debugging
5. CORS properly configured for frontend access
6. Health check endpoint for application status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 1.3 Completion Notes]

- Authentication service fully implemented with NextAuth v4.24.11 and tRPC
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens working
- Role-based access control with CONSULTANT, MANAGER, ADMIN roles implemented
- Rate limiting already implemented for auth endpoints in packages/api/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts
- Session management with SessionManager in packages/api/src/services/sessionManager.ts
- 29 API tests currently passing
- Environment variables properly validated without fallback values

### Tech Stack

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **API Framework**: tRPC v10.45.x (NOT Express/Fastify) - Type-safe remote procedure calls
- **Logging**: Pino v8.x for structured logging
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v4.24.x with JWT
- **Validation**: Zod v3.22.x for all input validation

### API Router Structure

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
The appRouter should follow this structure:

```typescript
export const appRouter = router({
  auth: authRouter, // EXISTS
  ticket: ticketRouter, // TO CREATE
  salesforce: salesforceRouter, // TO CREATE
  ai: aiRouter, // TO CREATE
  preview: previewRouter, // TO CREATE
  deployment: deploymentRouter, // TO CREATE
  audit: auditRouter, // TO CREATE
  integration: integrationRouter, // TO CREATE
});
```

### Existing Middleware Implementation

[Source: packages/api/src/trpc.ts]

- enforceUserIsAuthed middleware at lines 41-50
- requireRole middleware at lines 54-82
- protectedProcedure, requireConsultant, requireManager, requireAdmin at lines 84-88
- SuperJSON transformer for serialization at line 25
- Error formatting with Zod at lines 26-35

### Rate Limiting Implementation

[Source: packages/api/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts]

- checkRateLimit function already exists
- Currently uses in-memory Map for storage
- Applied to auth endpoints (register, login, password reset)
- Pattern: checkRateLimit(identifier, operation_type)

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **API Calls**: Never make direct HTTP calls - use tRPC only
- **Naming**: tRPC routers use camelCase (e.g., ticketRouter)
- **Validation**: All procedures must use Zod validation
- **Error Handling**: Use standard error handler in tRPC
- **Type Sharing**: Define types in packages/shared/src/types/

### Technical Constraints

- Must use tRPC, not Express/Fastify (epic requirement mentions Express/Fastify but architecture uses tRPC)
- All inputs must be validated with Zod
- Must maintain type safety throughout
- CORS configuration happens at Next.js API route level, not in tRPC
- Health check should be a tRPC procedure, not a REST endpoint

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables needed for this story. Existing configuration:

- DATABASE_URL (for health check)
- REDIS_URL (if implementing Redis-based rate limiting)
- NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET (already configured)

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Framework**: Vitest v1.2.x
- **Test Files**: Co-located as `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- **Test Execution**: Via `pnpm test` using Turborepo
- **Test Location**:
  - Unit tests: Next to source files (e.g., routers/ticket.test.ts)
  - Integration tests: packages/api/src/**tests**/

For this story specifically:

- Create unit tests for each new router
- Test rate limiting with different scenarios
- Mock external dependencies (database, Redis)
- Test logging middleware without producing actual logs
- Verify health check responds correctly
- Test CORS headers in integration tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** The implementation demonstrates excellent quality with comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria. The API layer has been successfully transformed from the original Express/Fastify requirement to use tRPC, maintaining type safety throughout. All 97 tests are passing, showing robust test coverage.

**Key Strengths:**

- Clean module organization with separate routers for each domain
- Comprehensive rate limiting with role-based tiers and exponential backoff
- Excellent logging implementation with correlation IDs and sensitive data redaction
- Well-structured health checks with multiple endpoints for different monitoring needs
- Proper CORS configuration for different environments

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The implementation is clean, follows best practices, and adheres to the project's architectural standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All routers use camelCase, Zod validation throughout, proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows unified structure with routers, middleware, utils organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 97 passing tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

All items have been addressed in the implementation:

- [x] tRPC router structure with module organization (AC 1)
- [x] Authentication middleware with JWT validation (AC 2)
- [x] Comprehensive rate limiting with role-based tiers (AC 3)
- [x] Request/response logging with Pino (AC 4)
- [x] CORS configuration for frontend access (AC 5)
- [x] Health check endpoints implemented (AC 6)

Future considerations (not blocking):

- [ ] Consider implementing Redis for distributed rate limiting (currently using in-memory)
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- [ ] Consider implementing API versioning strategy

### Security Review

**Strong Security Posture:**

- JWT validation in authentication middleware
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and DDoS attacks
- Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- Sensitive data redaction in logs (passwords, tokens, secrets)
- Proper CORS configuration limiting origins
- Role-based access control (CONSULTANT, MANAGER, ADMIN)

No security vulnerabilities identified.

### Performance Considerations

**Performance is well-handled:**

- In-memory rate limiting provides fast lookups
- Efficient middleware chaining in tRPC
- Health checks include response time metrics
- Logging uses Pino (one of the fastest Node.js loggers)
- Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit entries

**Note:** Redis implementation for rate limiting would be beneficial for horizontal scaling but not critical for MVP.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.4-api-layer-implementation.yml
Risk profile: Low risk - all critical components implemented with proper testing
NFR assessment: All non-functional requirements met

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met with excellent implementation quality

### Additional Notes

The development team has done an outstanding job with this story. The decision to use tRPC instead of Express/Fastify was architecturally sound, providing better type safety and integration with the Next.js stack. The comprehensive test suite (97 tests) demonstrates thorough coverage of all functionality.

Key achievements:

1. **Module Organization**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated routers
2. **Rate Limiting Excellence**: Role-based tiers with exponential backoff
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs
4. **Production Ready**: Health checks, metrics, and proper error handling

The implementation exceeds expectations for an API layer foundation.
