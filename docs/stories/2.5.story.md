## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.4 (Change Preview System) implementation:
- Preview and PreviewItem models are already in the database schema
- WebSocket subscriptions are configured for real-time updates
- Repository pattern is established and should be followed for new models
- Component structure uses apps/web/components/{feature}/ pattern
- tRPC routers use requireConsultant for protected procedures
- Optimistic updates implemented using Zustand for better UX
- E2E tests use Playwright with data-testid attributes

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ticket]

The existing Ticket model connects to Preview:
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: string;
  jiraKey: string;
  summary: string;
  description: string;
  status: TicketStatus;
  previews: Preview[];
  // ... other fields
}
```

New models needed for approval tracking (to be added to schema.prisma):
```prisma
model Approval {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  previewId    String
  userId       String
  status       String   // PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, MODIFIED
  comments     String?  @db.Text
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
  
  preview      Preview  @relation(fields: [previewId], references: [id])
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  items        ApprovalItem[]
}

model ApprovalItem {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  approvalId   String
  previewItemId String  @unique
  status       String   // APPROVED, REJECTED, MODIFIED
  modifiedData Json?    // If modified, store new data
  reason       String?  @db.Text
  
  approval     Approval     @relation(fields: [approvalId], references: [id])
  previewItem  PreviewItem  @relation(fields: [previewItemId], references: [id])
}
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

State Management approach:
- Server state managed by TanStack Query via tRPC
- Client state managed by Zustand for UI preferences
- Form state managed by React Hook Form
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Real-time updates via WebSocket subscriptions

tRPC Router structure for approval endpoints:
```typescript
export const approvalRouter = router({
  approveItems: requireConsultant
    .input(z.object({
      approvalId: z.string(),
      itemIds: z.array(z.string()),
      comments: z.string().optional()
    }))
    .mutation(),
    
  rejectItems: requireConsultant
    .input(z.object({
      approvalId: z.string(),
      itemIds: z.array(z.string()),
      reason: z.string()
    }))
    .mutation(),
    
  // ... other procedures
});
```

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

Components should be created in:
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The approval workflow implementation demonstrates solid architectural patterns with comprehensive functionality and good test coverage. The code follows the repository pattern correctly, implements proper separation of concerns, and provides excellent user experience with optimistic updates and real-time synchronization. However, critical security vulnerabilities and performance issues need immediate attention.

**Overall Score: 60/100** (100 - 20×2 FAIL items - 10×2 CONCERNS)

### Critical Security Issues Found

1. **Type Safety Bypass (CRITICAL)**: `packages/api/src/routers/approval.ts:172` uses `z.any()` for modifiedData validation, completely bypassing type safety. This creates vulnerability for injection attacks and data corruption.

2. **Unvalidated JSON Storage**: Modified approval data is stored without validation, allowing potentially malicious data to be persisted.

3. **Missing Rate Limiting**: Bulk approval operations lack rate limiting, creating DoS vulnerability.

### Performance Issues Identified

1. **N+1 Query Problem**: Individual fetching of preview items in modification flow causes unnecessary database queries.

2. **Inefficient State Updates**: Real-time updates iterate through all items repeatedly, causing UI performance degradation with large datasets.

3. **Memory Leak Risk**: Event emitter subscriptions may not be properly cleaned up in WebSocket connections.

### Refactoring Performed

Due to the critical nature of the security issues, I recommend addressing these in a dedicated security fix rather than refactoring during review. The issues require careful consideration of the data model and validation strategy.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Generally follows established patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Correct file organization and separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage (90%+ for services)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Fix Before Production):**
- [ ] Replace `z.any()` with proper Zod schema validation for modifiedData
- [ ] Implement JSON schema validation for all user-provided JSON data
- [ ] Add resource-level authorization to verify user can approve specific previews
- [ ] Fix N+1 query issues in bulk operations with proper batching

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware for approval endpoints
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for approval components
- [ ] Optimize real-time update performance with Map-based lookups
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and focus management for accessibility
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all approval actions

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Add virtualization for large approval queues (100+ items)
- [ ] Extract complex bulkApprove method into smaller functions
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across components
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Implement approval workflow analytics

### Security Review

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Type safety bypass with `z.any()` creates injection risk
- Unvalidated JSON storage allows data corruption
- Missing resource-level authorization checks

**Recommendations:**
- Implement strict JSON schema validation
- Add preview ownership verification
- Enable security audit logging
- Add rate limiting for all mutation endpoints

### Performance Considerations

**Database:**
- N+1 queries in modification flow need batching
- Excessive includes in repository methods impact query performance
- Consider implementing query result caching for frequently accessed data

**Frontend:**
- Large approval lists need virtualization for 100+ items
- Real-time updates cause unnecessary re-renders
- Consider implementing React.memo and useMemo for optimization

### Accessibility Review

**Issues Found:**
- Missing ARIA labels for complex interactions
- No focus management in modal dialogs
- Status changes not announced to screen readers
- Limited semantic markup in approval items

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. Critical security issues require careful implementation rather than quick fixes.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.5-approval-workflow-ui.yml
Risk profile: High security and performance risks identified
NFR assessment: Security and performance NFRs not fully met

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - Critical security issues must be addressed]

The implementation shows excellent functional completeness and user experience, but the security vulnerabilities (particularly the `z.any()` validation bypass) and performance issues must be resolved before this can move to production. Once these critical issues are addressed, this will be a solid implementation.
