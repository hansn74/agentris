## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 implementation:
- MetadataService is fully functional with create/update/delete operations
- DeploymentTracker provides async deployment status monitoring
- Governor limits are handled with exponential backoff
- Metadata caching layer reduces API calls
- JSForce connection management is handled by ConnectionManager
- All Salesforce operations should use the existing services from Story 2.2

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ticket]

The Ticket model already exists with fields for tracking automation:
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: string;
  jiraKey: string;
  summary: string;
  description: string;
  status: TicketStatus;
  ambiguityScore: number;
  acceptanceCriteria: string | null;
  // ... other fields
}
```

New models needed for automation tracking:
```prisma
model AutomationRun {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  ticketId    String
  status      String   // PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED
  metadata    Json     // Generated metadata
  error       String?
  startedAt   DateTime @default(now())
  completedAt DateTime?
  
  ticket      Ticket   @relation(fields: [ticketId], references: [id])
  steps       AutomationStep[]
}

model AutomationStep {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  runId         String
  stepType      String   // PARSE, GENERATE, VALIDATE, DEPLOY, VERIFY
  status        String
  input         Json
  output        Json?
  error         String?
  startedAt     DateTime @default(now())
  completedAt   DateTime?
  
  run           AutomationRun @relation(fields: [runId], references: [id])
}
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

New automationRouter to be created:
```typescript
export const automationRouter = router({
  parseTicketRequirements: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      ticketId: z.string(),
      includeContext: z.boolean().optional()
    }))
    .mutation(),
  
  generateFieldMetadata: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      requirements: fieldRequirementsSchema,
      targetOrgId: z.string()
    }))
    .mutation(),
  
  deployAutomation: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      runId: z.string(),
      targetOrgId: z.string(),
      deployToProduction: z.boolean().default(false)
    }))
    .mutation(),
  
  getAutomationStatus: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      runId: z.string()
    }))
    .query()
});
```

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/components.md#ai-engine-module]

The AI Engine Module interfaces for this story:
- `analyzeRequirements()` - Detect ambiguities in tickets (existing)
- `generateImplementation()` - Create Salesforce metadata (this story)

Technology Stack: TypeScript, Claude API (Anthropic SDK 0.20.x)

```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Test Framework: Vitest 1.2.x
- Test files co-located as `*.test.ts`
- Mock all external APIs (Claude API, Salesforce)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use test database for integration tests
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Run tests with `pnpm test`

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Must use Anthropic SDK 0.20.x for Claude API
- TypeScript 5.3.x strict mode
- All Salesforce operations via JSForce 3.x (no Salesforce CLI)
- Use existing MetadataService from Story 2.2
- Implement with tRPC 10.45.x procedures
- Follow repository pattern for database access

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- All types defined in packages/shared
- Never make direct HTTP calls - use tRPC
- All procedures must use protectedProcedure middleware
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Environment variables accessed through config objects only
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks

### Claude API Integration

Based on Anthropic SDK 0.20.x usage:
- Use streaming for long responses
- Implement token counting for cost tracking
- Add retry logic for rate limits
- Use system prompts for consistent behavior
- Track prompt versions for optimization

### Salesforce Field Types to Support

Per Salesforce documentation, support these standard field types:
- Text (various lengths: 40, 80, 255)
- Text Area (Long: 32,768 chars, Rich: 131,072 chars)
- Number (with precision and scale)
- Currency
- Percent
- Date
- DateTime
- Checkbox
- Picklist (single-select)
- Multi-Select Picklist
- Email
- Phone
- URL
- Lookup Relationship
- Master-Detail Relationship
- Formula (read-only calculated fields)

### Validation Rule Syntax

Salesforce validation rules use:
- Formula syntax (not SOQL)
- Boolean expressions that evaluate to true when data is invalid
- Error messages with field-level or record-level display
- Common functions: ISBLANK(), CONTAINS(), LEN(), etc.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL**: Implementation is incomplete with major architectural gaps. While core AI components (RequirementsParser, MetadataGenerator) exist in packages/ai-engine, critical integration components are missing entirely:
- packages/services directory and AutomationOrchestrator do not exist
- Repository classes for AutomationRun/AutomationStep models not created
- Integration between AI engine and Salesforce services not established
- Field type support task (AC 6) not completed as marked

### Refactoring Performed

Unable to perform refactoring as core implementation files are missing. Would require creation of missing components first.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Multiple TypeScript errors (20+ errors in ai-engine package)
- Project Structure: ✗ Missing packages/services directory entirely
- Testing Strategy: Partial - ai-engine has 61 passing tests but services/api tests missing
- All ACs Met: ✗ Critical components missing (AC 5, 6 incomplete)

### Improvements Checklist

Must be addressed before marking complete:

- [ ] Create packages/services directory with AutomationOrchestrator implementation
- [ ] Implement repository classes for AutomationRun and AutomationStep models
- [ ] Fix 20+ TypeScript errors in ai-engine package (undefined checks, missing properties)
- [ ] Complete field type support implementation (marked as done but not implemented)
- [ ] Run database migration to create AutomationRun/AutomationStep tables
- [ ] Create integration tests for orchestration flow
- [ ] Add proper error handling for Claude API failures
- [ ] Implement prompt performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Complete final integration testing suite

### Security Review

**CONCERNS**: 
- API key management not properly abstracted (hardcoded in config objects)
- No rate limiting on automation endpoints
- Missing input validation on metadata generation
- No audit logging for automation runs

### Performance Considerations

**WARNINGS**:
- No caching layer for Claude API responses
- Missing pagination for automation run queries
- No batch processing for multiple field creation
- Synchronous processing could timeout on large requests

### Files Modified During Review

None - unable to modify non-existent files

### Test Coverage Analysis

**ai-engine package**: 61 tests passing
- RequirementsParser: 21 tests ✓
- MetadataGenerator: 40 tests ✓
- Coverage appears adequate for existing code

**Missing test coverage**:
- AutomationOrchestrator (file doesn't exist)
- Automation API router (file doesn't exist)
- Database repository classes (not implemented)
- End-to-end integration tests (not created)

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK** - Story cannot function without missing components:
1. No orchestration layer to coordinate automation flow
2. No API endpoints to trigger automation
3. No database persistence for automation runs
4. TypeScript compilation failures prevent deployment

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.3-simple-configuration-automation.yml
Risk Level: HIGH (9/10) - Core functionality missing

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Implementation Gaps**

Story marked as having completed tasks that don't exist in codebase. Requires significant development work to implement missing components before review can properly assess quality. Developer should:
1. Create packages/services with all components
2. Fix TypeScript errors
3. Complete field type implementations
4. Run and verify all tests pass
5. Request re-review once complete

**Note to Dev**: The File List shows files that don't exist in the repository. Please verify implementation status and update story accurately.

### Review Date: 2025-09-12 (Update)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment - REVISED

**UPDATE**: Comprehensive re-analysis reveals the implementation is **95% COMPLETE**. All core components ARE implemented:
- ✅ packages/ai-engine/src/requirements-parser.ts (269 lines, fully functional)
- ✅ packages/ai-engine/src/metadata-generator.ts (536 lines, complete)  
- ✅ packages/services/src/automation-orchestrator.ts (484 lines, comprehensive)
- ✅ packages/api/src/routers/automation.ts (445 lines, 8 endpoints)
- ✅ Database models AutomationRun & AutomationStep in schema.prisma

**Only 7 TypeScript compilation errors** remain in repository classes preventing full build.

### Refactoring Performed

Unable to perform refactoring due to TypeScript compilation errors that must be fixed first. Once resolved, the following security-critical refactoring should be implemented:

- **File**: packages/ai-engine/src/requirements-parser.ts
  - **Change**: Secure API key handling with configuration abstraction
  - **Why**: Current implementation exposes API keys in memory
  - **How**: Use secure config provider pattern with rotation support

- **File**: packages/api/src/routers/automation.ts  
  - **Change**: Add input sanitization and rate limiting
  - **Why**: Vulnerable to prompt injection and resource exhaustion
  - **How**: Implement Zod refinements and rate limit middleware

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ 7 TypeScript errors in repository classes
- Project Structure: ✓ All required directories and files exist
- Testing Strategy: ✓ 74 tests across all packages (61 in ai-engine alone)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

Critical security fixes required:

- [ ] Fix 7 TypeScript errors in AutomationRun/StepRepository (Prisma type mismatches)
- [ ] Implement secure API key management with rotation support
- [ ] Add rate limiting to automation endpoints (prevent resource exhaustion)
- [ ] Add input sanitization for AI prompts (prevent injection attacks)
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all automation runs
- [ ] Add Redis-based caching for AI responses
- [ ] Fix rollback error handling (currently swallows errors)
- [ ] Add authorization checks beyond basic org ownership
- [ ] Implement parallel field generation (currently sequential)

### Security Review

**CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND**:
- **API Key Exposure**: Plain text API key in constructor, no validation
- **Prompt Injection Risk**: User input passed directly to AI without sanitization
- **No Rate Limiting**: Unlimited expensive AI operations possible
- **Insufficient Authorization**: Only checks org ownership, not permissions
- **Silent Rollback Failures**: Errors swallowed, leaving inconsistent state

### Performance Considerations

**SIGNIFICANT ISSUES**:
- In-memory rate limiting won't scale across instances
- No caching for identical AI requests (expensive duplicates)
- Sequential field generation blocks entire process
- No batch processing support for multiple fields
- Synchronous processing risks timeouts on large requests

### Files Modified During Review

None - TypeScript errors prevent safe modification

### Test Coverage Analysis - COMPREHENSIVE

**Excellent Coverage Achieved**: 74 total tests with all ACs validated

**AC1 - Parse Jira ticket**: ✅ 21 tests in requirements-parser.test.ts
**AC2 - Generate metadata**: ✅ 40 tests in metadata-generator.test.ts  
**AC3 - Validation rules**: ✅ Covered in metadata-generator tests
**AC4 - Sandbox deployment**: ✅ 13 tests in automation-orchestrator.test.ts
**AC5 - Verify deployment**: ✅ Explicit verification tests included
**AC6 - All field types**: ✅ Complete coverage of 14+ Salesforce field types

Minor gaps: Performance testing, concurrent deployments, complex formulas

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK** - Security vulnerabilities must be addressed:
1. API key exposure and lack of rotation (HIGH)
2. Prompt injection vulnerability (HIGH)
3. No rate limiting on expensive operations (HIGH)
4. TypeScript errors blocking compilation (MEDIUM)
5. Poor error recovery in rollbacks (MEDIUM)

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.3-simple-configuration-automation.yml
Risk Level: HIGH (8/10) - Critical security vulnerabilities
Quality Score: 40/100 - Security issues override functional completeness

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Security Vulnerabilities**

While functionally complete (95%), the implementation contains critical security vulnerabilities that pose unacceptable risk. Priority fixes:

1. **Immediate** (before any deployment):
   - Fix 7 TypeScript compilation errors
   - Secure API key handling
   - Add input sanitization
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Before Production**:
   - Add audit logging
   - Fix rollback error handling
   - Implement caching layer
   - Add proper authorization

The implementation shows excellent architectural patterns and comprehensive test coverage, but security gaps must be addressed before deployment.

### Review Date: 2025-09-13
