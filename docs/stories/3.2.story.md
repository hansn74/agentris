## Story

**As a** consultant,  
**I want** the system to identify unclear requirements,  
**So that** I can clarify them before starting work.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Identify vague terms and incomplete specifications
3. Detect conflicting requirements within ticket
4. Calculate ambiguity score with confidence level
5. Highlight specific ambiguous sections in UI
6. 90%+ accuracy on test set of known ambiguous tickets

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 successfully implemented the LLM integration service with:
- Comprehensive LLMService in packages/ai-engine/src/llm-service.ts
- Provider abstraction allowing easy provider switching
- Response caching using LLMRepository
- tRPC router for LLM endpoints at packages/api/src/routers/llm.ts
- Existing analyzeRequirements endpoint that can be extended for ambiguity detection
[Source: Story 3.1 Completion Notes]

### Existing LLM Infrastructure
The AI Engine package already has:
- LLMService with analyzeText() method ready for ambiguity detection
- Anthropic provider configured and tested
- Token tracking and cost monitoring integrated
- Retry logic and caching already implemented
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#/packages/ai-engine]

### Data Models
**Ticket Model** - Already exists with ambiguityScore field:
- ambiguityScore: Float - AI-detected ambiguity level (0.0 to 1.0)
- status field includes 'ANALYZING' state for processing
- Related Analysis model can store detailed ambiguity findings
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Ticket]

**Analysis Model** - For storing ambiguity detection results:
- Should link to Ticket via ticketId
- Store detected patterns, vague terms, conflicts
- Include confidence scores for each finding
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Analysis]

### API Specifications
**Existing LLM Router** (packages/api/src/routers/llm.ts):
- analyzeRequirements procedure already exists
- Currently calculates basic ambiguity score
- Can be extended to return detailed ambiguity findings
[Source: Story 3.1 File List]

**New Endpoints Needed**:
- `ambiguity.detect`: Comprehensive ambiguity analysis
- `ambiguity.getDetails`: Retrieve detailed findings for a ticket
- `ambiguity.updateScore`: Manually adjust ambiguity scores
[Source: architecture/components.md#AI Engine Module]

### Component Specifications
**AI Engine Module Requirements**:
- Key Interface: `analyzeRequirements()` - Detect ambiguities in tickets
- Already implemented in packages/ai-engine/src/llm-service.ts
- Needs enhancement for detailed pattern detection

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural design with comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria. The ambiguity detection engine successfully leverages the existing LLM infrastructure from Story 3.1, implementing parallel pattern detection, weighted scoring, and thorough error handling. The code is well-structured, follows repository patterns, and includes appropriate abstraction layers.

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated service, repository, and API layers
- Parallel execution of detection methods for optimal performance
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- Comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and validation tests
- Well-designed UI components with accessibility features (tooltips, color coding)
- Validation framework achieving the required 90%+ accuracy target

**Areas of Excellence:**
- The weighted scoring algorithm properly balances different ambiguity types
- Test dataset covers diverse scenarios from clear to highly ambiguous requirements
- Integration with existing LLMService avoids code duplication
- Repository pattern implementation follows best practices

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - the implementation is clean and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All standards met (types in shared, tRPC for API, repository pattern for DB)
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in designated packages
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage at unit and integration levels
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All tasks completed as specified
- [x] Test coverage comprehensive with mocked and integration tests
- [x] Validation framework implemented with accuracy testing
- [ ] Consider adding metrics/telemetry for production monitoring

- [ ] Consider implementing batch processing for multiple tickets

### Security Review

**Findings:**
- Input validation properly implemented with Zod schemas
- Protected procedures used for all API endpoints
- No SQL injection risks (using Prisma ORM)
- No sensitive data logged to console

**Recommendation:** Consider adding rate limiting to prevent potential DOS attacks on the LLM-intensive endpoints.

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Parallel execution of detection methods reduces latency
- Caching integrated via LLMService (24-hour TTL as specified)
- Async processing prevents UI blocking

**Suggestions:**
- Monitor LLM token usage in production for cost optimization
- Consider implementing request queuing for high-volume scenarios
