## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.5 (Jira Integration Service):
- Jira tRPC procedures available at packages/api/src/routers/jira.ts
- OAuth flow endpoints: jira.connect, jira.callback, jira.disconnect
- Ticket operations: jira.fetchTickets, jira.fetchTicketDetails
- Configuration endpoint: jira.updateSettings
- All procedures use protectedProcedure middleware for authentication
- Environment variables needed for Jira OAuth are configured

```

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.1.x with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.x
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI based)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.x
- **State Management**: 
  - Zustand 4.5.x for client state (UI preferences)
  - TanStack Query 5.x for server state (via tRPC)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form 7.49.x with Zod 3.22.x validation
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js 4.24.x
- **API Client**: tRPC client (type-safe)
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.2.x + Testing Library 14.x

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

Components should be organized as:
- `components/ui/` - shadcn/ui reusable components
- `components/layout/` - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- `components/ticket/` - Ticket-specific components
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (useAuth, etc.)
- `stores/` - Zustand stores for UI state

### State Management Patterns

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
- **Server State**: Managed by TanStack Query via tRPC
  - All API calls go through tRPC procedures
  - Automatic caching and invalidation
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
- **Client State**: Managed by Zustand
  - UI preferences (sidebar collapsed, theme, etc.)
  - Temporary form state not persisted to server
- **Form State**: React Hook Form
  - All forms use React Hook Form with Zod schemas
  - Validation schemas match backend validation

### tRPC Integration

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

Available tRPC procedures from packages/api/src/routers/jira.ts:
```typescript
// Authentication
jira.connect - Initiate OAuth flow
jira.callback - Handle OAuth callback
jira.disconnect - Revoke tokens

// Ticket Operations  
jira.fetchTickets - Get user's tickets
jira.fetchTicketDetails - Get full ticket details

// Configuration
jira.updateSettings - Update user's Jira settings
```

All procedures are wrapped with `protectedProcedure` middleware.

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `TicketList.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- **Type Sharing**: Import types from packages/shared
- **API Calls**: Never make direct HTTP calls - always use tRPC
- **Error Handling**: All tRPC calls must handle loading and error states
- **Validation**: All forms validated with Zod schemas
- **Async Operations**: Always show loading states
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly

### Authentication Flow

[Source: Previous stories + architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]

1. User navigates to app/(auth)/login
2. Login form submits credentials via NextAuth.js signIn()
3. NextAuth validates with JWT-based auth service (from Story 1.3)
4. On success, user redirected to dashboard
5. Protected routes use middleware to check session
6. Logout calls NextAuth signOut()

### Environment Variables Needed

These should already be configured from previous stories:
```
# From Story 1.3 - Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

# From Story 1.5 - Jira
JIRA_CLIENT_ID=your_jira_oauth_client_id
JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_jira_oauth_client_secret
JIRA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/jira/callback
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Framework**: Vitest 1.2.x
- **Component Testing**: Testing Library 14.x
- **Test Files**: Co-located as `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx`
- **Test Execution**: Via `pnpm test`
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.41.x for critical user flows

### Test Requirements for This Story

1. **Component Unit Tests** (co-located with components)
   - LoginForm.test.tsx - Test form validation and submission
   - TicketList.test.tsx - Test rendering, loading, error states
   - TicketDetail.test.tsx - Test detail display, markdown formatting
   - Layout.test.tsx - Test responsive behavior, navigation

2. **Hook Tests** (hooks/*.test.ts)
   - useAuth.test.ts - Test authentication state management
   - Custom hook tests for any ticket-related hooks

3. **Integration Tests** (app/**/*.test.tsx)
   - Test page components with mocked tRPC
   - Test protected route behavior
   - Test data fetching and error handling

4. **E2E Tests** (e2e/*.spec.ts)
   - Login flow: Login → Dashboard → Logout
   - Ticket viewing: Dashboard → Ticket List → Ticket Detail
   - Jira connection: Settings → Connect Jira → OAuth flow

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09
### Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
### Gate Decision: **CONCERNS**

#### Summary
Story 1.6 successfully implements a functional web UI shell with authentication, dashboard, and ticket views using a modern tech stack. However, critical gaps in real data integration and testing present significant risks.

#### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Modern tech stack properly configured (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4)
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile-friendly navigation
- ✅ Component-based architecture with clear separation
- ✅ Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- ✅ Loading states and error handling throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive Jira router with OAuth and encryption

**Critical Concerns:**
- ❌ Authentication using hardcoded mock credentials only
- ❌ No database integration (TODO in auth.ts)
- ❌ tRPC queries disabled - not connected to backend
- ❌ Mock data used instead of real API integration
- ❌ No E2E tests despite being required

**High Priority Issues:**
- ⚠️ Limited test coverage (5 files, missing integration tests)
- ⚠️ Test mocking issues preventing proper execution
- ⚠️ No accessibility testing implemented
- ⚠️ Security credentials exposed in UI
- ⚠️ Missing error boundaries

#### Requirements Coverage
- AC1 (React/TypeScript): ✅ PASS
- AC2 (Login/Logout): ⚠️ PARTIAL - Mock auth only
- AC3 (Dashboard/Tickets): ⚠️ PARTIAL - Mock data only
- AC4 (Ticket Detail): ✅ PASS
- AC5 (Responsive): ✅ PASS
- AC6 (Loading/Error): ⚠️ PARTIAL - Missing error boundaries

#### Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk**: HIGH - Hardcoded credentials, incomplete auth
- **Functionality Risk**: HIGH - Not connected to real backend
- **Performance Risk**: MEDIUM - No optimization implemented
- **Maintainability Risk**: MEDIUM - Good structure but large components

#### Must Fix Before Production
1. Replace mock authentication with database integration
2. Connect UI to actual tRPC endpoints
3. Implement required E2E tests
4. Remove hardcoded credentials
5. Add error boundaries

#### Recommendation
The UI shell is well-structured but not production-ready due to lack of backend integration and testing. Priority should be connecting to the backend services from previous stories before adding new features.
