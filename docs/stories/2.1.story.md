## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.6 completion, the following infrastructure is already in place:
- NextAuth.js authentication system configured and working
- tRPC client/server setup with protectedProcedure middleware
- Database connection with Prisma ORM
- Integration model in database supporting SALESFORCE type
- Error handling patterns established
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#organization]

The Organization model represents a connected Salesforce org with these attributes:
```typescript
interface Organization {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  instanceUrl: string;
  orgId: string;
  type: 'SANDBOX' | 'PRODUCTION';
  lastSync: Date | null;
  userId: string;
  user: User;
  deployments: Deployment[];
}
```

Note: The refreshToken field (encrypted) needs to be added to store OAuth tokens securely.

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

Current Integration model already exists:
```prisma
model Integration {
  id        String          @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  type      IntegrationType // Includes SALESFORCE
  config    Json            // Stores encrypted tokens and configuration
  isActive  Boolean         @default(true)
  createdAt DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime        @updatedAt
}
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

The salesforceRouter should follow this pattern (not yet implemented):
```typescript
export const salesforceRouter = router({
  // OAuth flow
  connect: protectedProcedure.input(z.object({
    orgType: z.enum(['SANDBOX', 'PRODUCTION']),
    instanceUrl: z.string().optional()
  })).mutation(),
  
  callback: protectedProcedure.input(z.object({
    code: z.string(),
    state: z.string()
  })).mutation(),
  
  // Connection management
  listOrgs: protectedProcedure.query(),
  testConnection: protectedProcedure.input(z.object({
    orgId: z.string()
  })).query(),
  disconnect: protectedProcedure.input(z.object({
    orgId: z.string()
  })).mutation()
});
```

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/components.md#salesforce-integration-module]

The Salesforce Integration Module has these key interfaces:
- `authenticate()` - OAuth and session management (this story)
- `deployMetadata()` - Deploy changes to org (future story - will require SF CLI)
- `retrieveMetadata()` - Fetch org configuration (future story - will require SF CLI)
- `runTests()` - Execute Apex tests (future story)

Technology Stack for this story: TypeScript, JSForce 3.x

```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Test Framework: Vitest 1.2.x
- Test files co-located as `*.test.ts`
- Mock external APIs (Salesforce OAuth)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use test database for integration tests
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Must use JSForce 3.x for Salesforce API operations
- TypeScript 5.3.x strict mode
- All async operations must have proper error handling
- Use Prisma 5.8.x for database operations
- Implement with tRPC 10.45.x procedures
- Note: Salesforce CLI will be added in Story 2.2 for metadata operations

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Never make direct HTTP calls - use JSForce client
- All procedures must use protectedProcedure middleware
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Use repository pattern for database access
- Environment variables accessed through config objects only
- Implement exponential backoff for API retries

### Environment Variables Needed

These environment variables will need to be configured:
```
# Salesforce OAuth Configuration
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=your_connected_app_client_id
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_connected_app_client_secret
SALESFORCE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/salesforce/callback

# Encryption for token storage
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key
```

### Security Considerations

- OAuth refresh tokens must be encrypted before storage
- Use Integration model's config field with encryption
- Implement PKCE for OAuth flow security
- Validate Salesforce instance URLs to prevent phishing
- Rate limit authentication attempts
- Log all authentication events for audit trail

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Test Framework: Vitest 1.2.x
- Test Execution: Via `pnpm test`
- Test Organization: Co-located with source files

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid OAuth 2.0 authentication architecture with JSForce 3.x. All 6 acceptance criteria have been met with appropriate separation of concerns across auth, connection management, and token refresh services. The code follows the repository pattern and integrates properly with the existing tRPC infrastructure.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/integrations/salesforce/src/auth.ts
  - **Change**: Added CSRF state validation and removed sensitive data from logs
  - **Why**: Security vulnerability - state parameter wasn't validated, logs exposed user IDs
  - **How**: Validates state belongs to user, removes PII from logging

- **File**: packages/integrations/salesforce/src/auth.ts
  - **Change**: Added Salesforce domain validation for instance URLs
  - **Why**: Security - prevent phishing attacks via malicious instance URLs
  - **How**: Validates URLs against known Salesforce domains before connecting

- **File**: packages/api/src/routers/salesforce.ts
  - **Change**: Implemented rate limiting for authentication attempts
  - **Why**: Security - protect against brute force and abuse
  - **How**: Tracks attempts per user with 5 attempts per 15-minute window

- **File**: packages/integrations/salesforce/src/auth.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeScript issues with jsforce types and async refresh
  - **Why**: Type safety and proper async handling
  - **How**: Updated to use Promise-based refresh instead of callback pattern

- **File**: packages/integrations/salesforce/src/*.test.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed all failing test mocks for jsforce OAuth2
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to incorrect mock setup
  - **How**: Updated mocks to match actual jsforce API behavior

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows repository pattern, proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly organized in packages/integrations/salesforce
- Testing Strategy: ✓ 47/47 tests passing, comprehensive coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added CSRF protection with state validation
- [x] Implemented rate limiting for auth attempts
- [x] Added Salesforce domain validation
- [x] Removed sensitive data from logs
- [x] Fixed all TypeScript type issues
- [x] Fixed all failing tests (47/47 passing)
- [ ] Consider migrating state store to Redis for production
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for failed auth attempts
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for token refresh retries

### Security Review

**Issues Found and Addressed:**
1. **CRITICAL (Fixed)**: Missing CSRF state validation - now validates state tokens
2. **HIGH (Fixed)**: No instance URL validation - now validates Salesforce domains
3. **MEDIUM (Fixed)**: No rate limiting - implemented 5 attempts per 15 minutes
4. **LOW (Fixed)**: Sensitive data in logs - removed user IDs from log output

**Remaining Considerations:**
- State store should use Redis/database in production (currently in-memory)
- Consider adding IP-based rate limiting in addition to user-based

### Performance Considerations

- Token refresh uses efficient checking (15 minutes before expiry)
- Scheduled refresh runs every 30 minutes to minimize API calls
- Connection pooling via JSForce handles concurrent requests well
- Rate limiting prevents abuse without impacting legitimate usage

### Files Modified During Review

- packages/integrations/salesforce/src/auth.ts
- packages/integrations/salesforce/src/auth.test.ts
- packages/integrations/salesforce/src/connection.ts
- packages/integrations/salesforce/src/connection.test.ts
- packages/api/src/routers/salesforce.ts

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-salesforce-authentication-service.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to authentication/security scope
NFR assessment: Security improvements implemented, performance acceptable

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
(Story owner decides final status)

**Key Concerns:**
1. State store needs production-ready implementation (Redis/DB)
2. Consider adding monitoring for security events
3. Implement exponential backoff for resilience

The implementation is functionally complete with all ACs met, but the security improvements should be considered before production deployment.

### Review Date: 2025-09-11 (Second Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation has matured significantly since the initial review. All critical security issues identified have been addressed with proper CSRF protection via database-backed state management, comprehensive security event logging, and well-implemented rate limiting. The code demonstrates excellent separation of concerns with dedicated services for state management and security events.

### Architecture Review

**Strengths:**
- Proper OAuth 2.0 implementation with JSForce 3.x
- Database-backed CSRF state validation (addresses previous concern)
- Comprehensive security event logging and alerting
- Exponential backoff with jitter for token refresh
- Clean separation between auth, connection, and token refresh services
- Excellent error handling without exposing sensitive information

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Rate limiting uses in-memory storage (Map) which won't scale across multiple instances
- Security event retention policy needs configuration (currently hardcoded to 90 days)
- Missing OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows repository pattern, proper error handling, TypeScript strict mode
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly organized in packages/integrations/salesforce
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Test files present for all major components
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented with enhancements

### Security Review Update

**Previously Fixed Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL**: CSRF protection - ✓ Now uses database-backed state validation
2. **HIGH**: Domain validation - ✓ Validates Salesforce domains properly
3. **MEDIUM**: Rate limiting - ✓ Implemented with configurable thresholds
4. **LOW**: Sensitive data in logs - ✓ PII removed from all log statements

**New Observations:**
1. **MEDIUM**: Rate limit storage is in-memory (Map) - won't work across multiple server instances
2. **LOW**: Security event alerting only logs - production needs email/SMS integration
3. **LOW**: No IP-based rate limiting in addition to user-based

### Performance Considerations

- Token refresh intelligently checks 15 minutes before expiry
- Scheduled refresh runs every 30 minutes (configurable)
- Database queries are properly indexed for performance
- Cleanup tasks prevent unbounded growth of state/event tables

### Test Coverage Assessment

- Unit tests exist for auth.ts, connection.ts, and token-refresh.ts
- Integration test exists for salesforce router
- Tests cover success and failure scenarios
- Mock strategies properly isolate external dependencies

### Risk Profile

- **Authentication Risk**: LOW (comprehensive security measures in place)
- **Data Protection Risk**: LOW (encryption at rest, secure token handling)
- **Availability Risk**: MEDIUM (in-memory rate limiting won't scale)
- **Compliance Risk**: LOW (proper audit logging via security events)

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Production Blockers):**
- [ ] Migrate rate limiting to Redis or database for multi-instance support
- [ ] Configure security event retention policy via environment variables

**Future Enhancements:**
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for observability
- [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting in addition to user-based
- [ ] Add email/SMS alerts for security events
- [ ] Consider implementing refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- [ ] Add metrics collection for auth success/failure rates

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-salesforce-authentication-service.yml
Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM
NFR Assessment: Security excellent, performance good, scalability needs attention

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done]

The story has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with robust security measures. The remaining recommendations are primarily for production scalability and observability, which can be addressed in future stories as the system scales.
