# Story 2.6: Basic Deployment & Rollback

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** consultant,  
**I want** changes deployed safely with rollback capability,  
**So that** mistakes can be quickly corrected.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Deploy approved changes to selected Salesforce org
2. Real-time deployment status updates in UI
3. Automatic rollback on deployment failure
4. Manual rollback option available post-deployment
5. Deployment logs accessible for debugging
6. Success/failure notifications to user

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.5 (Approval Workflow UI) completed with:
- Approval and ApprovalItem models for tracking approved changes
- Comprehensive security with Zod validation and resource-level authorization
- modifiedData stored as JSON in ApprovalItem for approved modifications
- Real-time updates via EventEmitter pattern
- Successful QA gate with all security vulnerabilities resolved

### Data Models

#### Existing Deployment Model
[Source: packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma]
```prisma
model Deployment {
  id             String                 @id @default(cuid())
  organizationId String
  deploymentId   String                 @unique
  status         String
  metadata       Json
  createdAt      DateTime               @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime               @updatedAt
  
  // Relations
  organization   SalesforceOrganization @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@index([organizationId])
  @@index([deploymentId])
}
```

#### Need to Add DeploymentLog Model
```prisma
model DeploymentLog {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  deploymentId String
  level        String   // INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  message      String   @db.Text
  timestamp    DateTime @default(now())
  metadata     Json?
  
  deployment   Deployment @relation(fields: [deploymentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@index([deploymentId])
  @@index([timestamp])
}

model DeploymentRollback {
  id               String   @id @default(cuid())
  deploymentId     String
  rollbackMetadata Json     // Store original state for rollback
  status           String   // PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
  initiatedBy      String
  createdAt        DateTime @default(now())
  completedAt      DateTime?
  
  deployment   Deployment @relation(fields: [deploymentId], references: [id])
  user         User       @relation(fields: [initiatedBy], references: [id])
}
```

### API Specifications

#### Existing DeploymentTracker Service
[Source: packages/integrations/salesforce/src/deployment-tracker.ts]
- Already has polling mechanism for deployment status
- ConnectionManager for Salesforce connections
- Queue management for deployments
- Methods: `checkDeploymentStatus()`, polling interval configuration

#### Required tRPC Endpoints
```typescript
// packages/api/src/routers/deployment.ts
deploymentRouter = {
  // Deploy approved changes
  deployChanges: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      approvalId: z.string(),
      targetOrgId: z.string(),
      options: z.object({
        runTests: z.boolean().default(false),
        checkOnly: z.boolean().default(false),
      }).optional(),
    }))
    .mutation(),
  
  // Get deployment status with real-time updates
  getDeploymentStatus: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      deploymentId: z.string(),
    }))
    .subscription(),
  
  // Initiate rollback
  rollbackDeployment: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      deploymentId: z.string(),
      reason: z.string(),
    }))
    .mutation(),
  
  // Get deployment logs
  getDeploymentLogs: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      deploymentId: z.string(),
      level: z.enum(['ALL', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']).optional(),
    }))
    .query(),
}
```

### Component Specifications

#### UI Components Required
- `DeploymentPanel` - Main deployment interface showing approved items ready to deploy
- `DeploymentStatus` - Real-time status indicator with progress
- `DeploymentLogs` - Log viewer with filtering and search
- `RollbackDialog` - Confirmation and reason for rollback
- `DeploymentNotification` - Success/failure toast notifications

#### State Management
```typescript
interface DeploymentState {
  activeDeployments: Map<string, DeploymentInfo>;
  deploymentLogs: DeploymentLog[];
  rollbackHistory: DeploymentRollback[];
  selectedOrgId: string | null;
  isDeploying: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

- Service: `packages/services/src/deployment.ts`
- Repository: `packages/db/src/repositories/DeploymentRepository.ts`
- API Router: `packages/api/src/routers/deployment.ts`
- UI Components: `apps/web/components/deployment/`
- Store: `apps/web/stores/deploymentStore.ts`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests for deployment service methods
- Integration tests for Salesforce API calls

### Technical Constraints

#### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- JSForce 3.x for Salesforce Metadata API
- WebSocket subscriptions via tRPC for real-time updates
- Zustand for deployment state management
- Prisma for deployment tracking persistence

#### Salesforce Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#salesforce-integration-module]
- Use existing `deployMetadata()` interface
- Leverage `retrieveMetadata()` for rollback snapshots
- Use `runTests()` when deployment includes test execution

#### Security Considerations
- Verify user has permission to deploy to target org
- Audit log all deployment actions
- Encrypt rollback metadata containing org state
- Rate limit deployment operations

## QA Results

### Review Date
2025-09-15

### Decision
**PASS** ✅

### Test Coverage
- Unit Tests: ✅ 92% coverage for DeploymentService
- Integration Tests: ✅ All deployment router endpoints tested
- E2E Tests: ✅ Full deployment scenarios including rollback

### Security Review
- **Authorization**: ✅ All endpoints protected with user/org verification
- **Input Validation**: ✅ Zod schemas for all inputs
- **Data Protection**: ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- **Audit Logging**: ✅ Comprehensive deployment tracking

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Rollback metadata as untyped JSON (mitigated by validation)
- **Low Risk**: Long-running deployment polling (configurable timeouts)
- **Medium Risk**: Potential orphaned deployments (cleanup job implemented)

### Compliance Summary
✅ All 6 acceptance criteria met
✅ Security controls properly implemented
✅ Comprehensive test coverage achieved
✅ Error handling and recovery mechanisms in place
✅ Real-time updates via WebSocket functioning

### QA Notes
Excellent implementation with strong security controls, comprehensive logging, and robust error handling. The event-driven architecture enables real-time deployment tracking while automatic rollback provides safety for failed deployments. Test coverage is thorough with E2E scenarios covering all critical paths.
