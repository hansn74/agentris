# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Agentris, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template: T3 Stack with Turborepo

Based on the requirements analysis, Agentris will be built using the T3 Stack (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + TypeScript) with Turborepo for monorepo management. This provides:

- End-to-end type safety with tRPC
- Built-in OAuth support via NextAuth.js
- Excellent developer experience with hot reload
- Clear migration path to microservices if needed
