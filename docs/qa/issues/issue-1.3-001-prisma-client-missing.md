# Build Failure Issue Report

**Bug ID**: EPIC-1-001
**Story**: 1.3 (Core Authentication Service)
**Test Scenario**: 1.1.1 (Development Environment Setup)
**Severity**: Critical
**Date Reported**: 2025-09-10

## Description
The build process fails due to missing Prisma Client generation. The `@agentris/db` package cannot find the `PrismaClient` export from `@prisma/client`, indicating that the Prisma Client has not been generated after schema definition.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm build`
4. Build fails at `@agentris/db` package

## Expected Result
Build should complete successfully with all packages compiled.

## Actual Result
Build fails with TypeScript errors:
```
@agentris/db:build: src/index.ts:1:10 - error TS2305: Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'.
@agentris/db:build: src/index.ts:16:10 - error TS2305: Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The Prisma Client needs to be generated from the schema before it can be imported. This is typically done with:
- `npx prisma generate` or
- `pnpm db:generate`

The development setup is missing the Prisma Client generation step after installation.

## Proposed Fix

### Option 1: Add postinstall script
In `packages/db/package.json`, add:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Update root package.json
Add a setup script that includes Prisma generation:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "pnpm install && pnpm db:generate",
    "db:generate": "turbo run db:generate",
    "postinstall": "turbo run db:generate"
  }
}
```

In `packages/db/package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:generate": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Update README with setup instructions
Add to the setup steps:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd agentris

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate Prisma Client
pnpm db:generate  # or cd packages/db && npx prisma generate

# Build all packages
pnpm build
```

## Immediate Workaround
Users can manually generate the Prisma Client before building:
```bash
cd packages/db
npx prisma generate
cd ../..
pnpm build
```

## Environment
- OS: macOS
- Node Version: (check with `node --version`)
- pnpm Version: (check with `pnpm --version`)
- Location: Fresh clone of repository

## Impact
- Blocks new developer onboarding
- Prevents successful build on fresh clones
- CI/CD pipeline may also be affected if not generating Prisma Client

## Related Files
- `packages/db/src/index.ts` - Trying to import PrismaClient
- `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` - Schema definition exists
- `packages/db/package.json` - Missing generation script

## Testing Notes
After fix is applied, verify:
1. Fresh clone and install works
2. `pnpm build` succeeds without manual intervention
3. CI/CD pipeline still works
4. Existing developer environments not broken

## Priority
**Critical** - Blocks basic development setup for all new contributors
