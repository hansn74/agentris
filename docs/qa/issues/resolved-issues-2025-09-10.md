# QA Issues Resolution Report
**Date**: 2025-09-10
**Developer**: James (Dev Agent)

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Prisma Client Generation Failure (EPIC-1-001)
**Severity**: Critical
**Story**: 1.3 (Core Authentication Service)

#### Issue
Build process failed due to missing Prisma Client generation. The `@agentris/db` package could not find `PrismaClient` export.

#### Resolution
- Added `postinstall` script to root `package.json` to automatically run `turbo db:generate` after installation
- This ensures Prisma Client is generated for all new clones and fresh installations

#### Files Modified
- `/package.json` - Added postinstall script

### 2. TypeScript Build Errors in Integrations Package
**Severity**: High
**Package**: @agentris/integrations

#### Issues Found
Multiple TypeScript errors preventing compilation:
- Missing type annotations for JSON responses
- Incorrect jira.js client configuration (telemetry field)
- Missing type exports (InternalTicket)
- Test file mocking issues
- Index access errors on fields objects

#### Resolution
- Added proper type annotations for OAuth token responses
- Removed unsupported `telemetry` field from jira.js client config
- Exported `InternalTicket` interface from mappers
- Fixed test mocking for Version3Client
- Added type assertions for dynamic field access
- Added `@agentris/integrations` dependency to API package
- Updated tsconfig references to include integrations package

#### Files Modified
- `/packages/integrations/jira/src/auth.ts` - Added type annotations
- `/packages/integrations/jira/src/client.ts` - Removed telemetry field, fixed comment body structure
- `/packages/integrations/jira/src/client.test.ts` - Fixed mock types
- `/packages/integrations/jira/src/mappers/ticket.ts` - Exported InternalTicket interface
- `/packages/integrations/jira/src/services/ticket.ts` - Added type assertions and null checks
- `/packages/integrations/src/jira.ts` - Added InternalTicket to exports
- `/packages/integrations/tsconfig.json` - Added composite: true
- `/packages/api/package.json` - Added integrations dependency
- `/packages/api/tsconfig.json` - Added integrations to references
- `/packages/api/src/routers/jira.ts` - Fixed logger calls
- `/packages/api/src/routers/jira.test.ts` - Fixed optional chaining

## Build Status

### Packages Building Successfully ✅
- @agentris/shared
- @agentris/db
- @agentris/auth
- @agentris/ai-engine
- @agentris/services
- @agentris/integrations
- @agentris/api

### Packages with Remaining Issues ⚠️
- web - Has TypeScript error in integrations page (trpc.jira.connect not found)
  - This appears to be a separate issue with the web app's tRPC configuration

## Outstanding QA Concerns

From the QA gate reviews, the following issues still need to be addressed:

### Story 1.5 - Jira Integration (CONCERNS)
1. **OAuth tokens stored in plain text** (Critical Security)
   - Location: packages/api/src/routers/jira.ts:103-106
   - Need to implement encryption for OAuth tokens
   
2. **Missing Prisma schema for jiraOAuthState table** (Medium)
   - Need to add table definition to schema.prisma

### Story 1.6 - Web UI Shell (CONCERNS)
1. **Hardcoded mock credentials** (Critical)
   - Using test@example.com/password123
   - Need real database integration
   
2. **tRPC queries disabled** (Critical)
   - enabled:false due to missing endpoints
   - Need to connect UI to backend
   
3. **No E2E tests** (High)
   - Required by acceptance criteria
   - Need Playwright configuration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Implement OAuth token encryption using the crypto utilities in @agentris/shared
2. Add jiraOAuthState table to Prisma schema
3. Fix web app tRPC configuration to recognize jira router
4. Remove hardcoded credentials from login form

### Testing Requirements
1. Run full test suite to verify no regressions
2. Add E2E tests for critical user flows
3. Add integration tests for API endpoints

## Summary

Successfully resolved the critical build-blocking issues:
- ✅ Prisma Client generation now automated
- ✅ TypeScript errors in integrations package fixed
- ✅ 7 out of 8 packages now building successfully

The codebase can now be built (except for the web app which has a separate tRPC configuration issue). The critical security issues identified in the QA gates still need to be addressed before production deployment.
