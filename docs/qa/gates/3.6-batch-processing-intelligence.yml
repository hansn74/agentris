  decision: "PASS WITH CONCERNS"
  score: 7.5
  
summary: |
  Story 3.6 successfully implements batch processing intelligence with comprehensive 
  functionality across all layers. Core requirements are met with good test coverage, 
  but gaps in UI testing and external integration testing need attention before 
  production deployment.

  - "Transactional database operations"
  - "Fallback handling for LLM failures"

conclusion: |
  The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with well-structured code,
  appropriate design patterns, and good test coverage at the service layer. The core
  functionality works as specified, but production readiness is blocked by missing UI
  tests, lack of rate limiting, and absence of real Jira integration tests. With the
  identified issues addressed, this would be a robust batch processing system.
  
  The team should prioritize the "required before production" items, especially UI
  testing and rate limiting, before deploying to production environments.
