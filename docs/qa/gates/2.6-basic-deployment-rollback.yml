risks_identified:
  - risk: "Rollback metadata storage as untyped JSON"
    severity: LOW
    mitigation: "JSON validation during rollback execution"
    location: packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma
  
  - risk: "Long-running deployment polling"
    severity: LOW
    mitigation: "Configurable timeout and max poll attempts"
    location: packages/services/src/deployment.ts:57-60
  
  - risk: "Potential for orphaned deployments"
    severity: MEDIUM
    mitigation: "Cleanup job for old logs implemented"
    location: packages/db/src/repositories/DeploymentRepository.ts:237-250

recommendations:
  - Consider adding deployment queue management for concurrent deployments
  - Implement retry logic for transient Salesforce API failures
  - Add deployment history archival for older deployments
  - Consider implementing deployment approval workflow for production

notes: |
  Story 2.6 implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices with
  comprehensive error handling, security controls, and test coverage. The
  deployment and rollback functionality is well-architected with proper
  separation of concerns and real-time update capabilities.
  
  Key strengths:
  - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
  - Comprehensive logging and audit trail
  - Automatic and manual rollback capabilities
  - Strong security controls with authorization checks
  - Excellent test coverage including E2E scenarios
  
  The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and maintains
  consistency with the existing codebase patterns established in previous stories.
