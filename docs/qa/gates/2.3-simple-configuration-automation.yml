risk_summary:
  security_risk: 2  # Low - all vulnerabilities addressed
  performance_risk: 3  # Low - acceptable with optimization opportunities
  reliability_risk: 2  # Low - error handling improved
  overall_risk: 2  # Low - ready for production

technical_debt:
  - In-memory rate limiting will need Redis for multi-instance scaling
  - Caching layer would improve AI response times
  - Audit trail implementation recommended for compliance

notes: |
  POST-SECURITY-FIX REVIEW: All critical security vulnerabilities identified in the 
  previous review have been successfully addressed:
  
  1. API Key Security: Implemented ApiKeyProvider with environment validation, 
     rotation support, and secure singleton pattern
  2. Prompt Injection Protection: Created PromptSanitizer with comprehensive 
     pattern detection and input normalization
  3. Rate Limiting: Applied to all automation endpoints with appropriate limits
  4. Error Handling: Rollback failures now properly surfaced with error details
  5. TypeScript Compilation: All Prisma type issues resolved
  
  The implementation demonstrates excellent security practices and is ready for 
  production deployment. Remaining recommendations are performance optimizations 
  that can be addressed in future iterations without blocking deployment.
  
  Test coverage remains strong at 61 tests with all acceptance criteria validated.
