resolution_summary: |
  All critical security vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved:

  1. z.any() validation bypass - Fixed with comprehensive Zod schema
  2. Unvalidated JSON - Fixed with type validation and dangerous pattern detection
  3. Missing authorization - Fixed with resource-level permission checks
  4. N+1 queries - Fixed with optimized database queries
  5. Rate limiting - Fixed with tiered rate limits for different operations

  The approval workflow is now secure and ready for production use.
  Service tests passing (8/8). Security patterns documented in docs/qa/security-fixes-2.5.md
