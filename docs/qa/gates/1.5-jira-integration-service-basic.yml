summary: |
  The Jira integration implementation is of exceptionally high quality with enterprise-grade patterns
  and comprehensive functionality. All 6 acceptance criteria are fully met. The implementation 
  demonstrates excellent architectural design, robust error handling with circuit breakers, 
  and proper OAuth 2.0 flow implementation.

  However, there is one critical security issue that must be addressed before production deployment:
  OAuth tokens are stored in plain text in the database. This represents a significant security
  risk that requires immediate remediation.

  Once the token encryption is implemented and the minor test failures are fixed, this 
  implementation will be production-ready with excellent quality standards.
