security_issues:
  critical:
    - issue: "XSS vulnerability via dangerouslySetInnerHTML"
      components: ["MockupView", "TextView"]
      recommendation: "Implement DOMPurify sanitization"
      severity: "HIGH"
      
    - issue: "No rate limiting on AI generation"
      endpoint: "generateIntelligentPreview"
      recommendation: "Add rate limiting middleware"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      
  warnings:
    - issue: "z.any() schema validation"
      location: "API router metadata handling"
      recommendation: "Define strict schemas"
      severity: "LOW"

performance_assessment:
  strengths:
    - "Sub-second change detection"
    - "Efficient preview caching"
    - "Lazy component loading"
    
  concerns:
    - "Mermaid.js rendering for large diagrams"
    - "No virtualization for large graphs"
    - "Missing loading states during render"

code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns"
    - "Comprehensive type safety"
    - "Good error handling"
    - "Consistent patterns"
    
  issues:
    - "Magic numbers in confidence calculation"
    - "Some any types remain"
    - "Missing JSDoc comments"
    
  technical_debt:
    - "Confidence calculation algorithm needs refinement"
    - "Preview format mapping could be simplified"
    - "Some duplication in view components"

required_actions:
  must_fix:
    - "Add HTML sanitization to prevent XSS"
    - "Implement rate limiting on preview generation"
    
  should_fix:
    - "Replace z.any() with proper schemas"
    - "Add E2E integration tests"
    - "Add JSDoc comments for public APIs"
    
  nice_to_have:
    - "Add virtualization for large graphs"
    - "Implement preview pre-generation"
    - "Add performance monitoring"

risk_matrix:
  high_risk:
    - "XSS vulnerability in UI components"
    - "Resource exhaustion via unlimited generation"
    
  medium_risk:
    - "LLM response parsing failures"
    - "Preview expiration edge cases"
    
  low_risk:
    - "Change detection accuracy"
    - "Format selection logic"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Security hardening before production"
    - "Rate limiting implementation"
    
  short_term:
    - "E2E test suite development"
    - "Schema validation improvements"
    
  long_term:
    - "Performance optimization for large previews"
    - "Preview caching strategy"
    - "Monitoring and alerting setup"

decision_rationale: |
  The story successfully implements all acceptance criteria with good overall quality.
  The change detection and preview generation architecture is well-designed and extensible.
  Security concerns around XSS and rate limiting must be addressed before production.
  The implementation shows good engineering practices but needs security hardening.
  
final_verdict: "APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS - Security fixes required before production deployment"
